### Who caused the incident?
A hospital employee, most likely a nurse or staff member with access to a workstation, unintentionally triggered the ransomware by interacting with a phishing email.

### Where did the incident happen?
On a workstation inside the hospital’s network. The infection began after the employee opened the phishing email.

## Additional Notes

- Staff involved will need stronger phishing awareness training to prevent future incidents.  
- Ransomware in a hospital environment is extremely serious and highlights the need for better email filtering, user education, and strong endpoint protection.
